# UCLA Map
I'm a big fan of maps, and all I wanted to hang on the wall of my room was an interesting map of my alma mater.  Something unique.  I looked on Etsy and Society6 and a bunch of other custom art websites, but I couldn't find anything that fit my fancy.  So I decided to make my own!

### QGIS
I didn't have any experience with map-making software, but smart people pointed me to QGIS, a free, powerful, open-source GIS (Geographic Information System) program.  Using open-source community-derived maps from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

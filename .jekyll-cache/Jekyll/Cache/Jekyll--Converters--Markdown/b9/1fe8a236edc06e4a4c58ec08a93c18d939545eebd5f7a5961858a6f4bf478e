<p>UCLA Sustainability runs an annual event called Ecochella, a campus concert that runs entirely on pedal power.  Teams of UCLA engineers design and build bicycles that concert-goers ride to keep the concert powered.</p>

<p>For Ecochella 2014, twenty-five teams put in a proposal to a UCLA Electrical Engineering faculty panel.  After two design reviews and revisions, our team was one of seven to build a bike for the concert itself.  We decided on a belt drive around a tire-less wheel, with an LED voltmeter to act as a speedometer for the rider.
This was one of the first actual engineering projects I embarked on in school and – though it was eventually successful – it required a lot of last-minute tweaking and tuning to get right.  I learned a lot of lessons from the experience, which I applied to all of my future projects and engineering endeavors.</p>

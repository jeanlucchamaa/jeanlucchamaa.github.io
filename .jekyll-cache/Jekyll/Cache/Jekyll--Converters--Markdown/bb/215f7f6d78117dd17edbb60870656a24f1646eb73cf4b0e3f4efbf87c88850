I"é<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Jean-Luc â€” an excessively enthusiastic engineer, designer, and maker.  I enjoy creating novel hardware and software widgets, especially in partnership with other engineers.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelorâ€™s from UCLA in Mechanical Engineering (with technical breadth in Computer Science), 4+ years of professional experience as a software engineer, and 8+ years of project-based hands-on experience in electrical engineering, software engineering, and web development.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a diligent self-learner who takes on projects with heart, both at and outside of work.  Iâ€™m always building some passion project at home, outside of being a full-time employee or student, typically doubling down my efforts during breaks, weekends, and holidays when I have more time to devote.  <a href="projects">Hereâ€™s a list of some of the fun projects Iâ€™ve worked on.</a> .</p>

<p>I really have a passion for the work I do, and I thrive in workplaces where people feel likewise.  If you have a job or a project that I might be able to help you with, please do reach out via e-mail at <a href="mailto:jlchamaa@gmail.com">jlchamaa@gmail.com</a>.</p>

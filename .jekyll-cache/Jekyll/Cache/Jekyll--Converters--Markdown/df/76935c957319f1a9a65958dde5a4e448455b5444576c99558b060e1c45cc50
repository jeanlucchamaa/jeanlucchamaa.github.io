I"è<p>IDEAHacks, the premier west coast hardware hackathon, is hosted in Ackerman Grand Ballroom at UCLA. On a 36-hour time limit, along with two of my UCLA Aerospace engineering friends and a computer scientist from USC, we developed <strong>Soundscape</strong>!  We placed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ideahacks.la/photos/a.1456888661229688.1073741828.1451652401753314/1653275828257636/">third</a> in the competition and won Fitbits!</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h3>

<p>Soundscape is a tool that allows the speakers in your home or office to adjust their volume based upon how close you are to the speaker.  The expected use case: as you move from your bedroom to the kitchen, the music playing on the bedroom speakers gradually fades out and the kitchen speakers fade in, creating a landscape of sound that follows you seemlessly throughout the home.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h4>
<p>Before I tell you, do you promise not to judge?</p>

<p>There are three tricks to pull this off in concert, each one a dirtier hack than the last.</p>
<h5 id="1-calculate-location">1. Calculate Location</h5>
<p>Short of smart motion tracking cameras, doing precise real-time location tracking of an individual through the home is tricky.  Luckily, most of us are constantly carrying the powerful multi-band emitter known as a cell phone.  An Arduino UNO with a wifi shield, seated next to the speaker, measures the 2.4GHz wi-fi signal strength coming off of your phone and does some quick math to guesstimate your distance from the speaker.  3 speakers allows the system to roughly triangulate your location.</p>
<h5 id="2-modulate-volume">2. Modulate Volume</h5>
<p>With your rough location determined, each Arduino decides the volume intensity via a lookup table that roughly resembles a logistic function. The Arduino actually supresses the constant amplitude audio signal from to source X% by applying X% duty cycle pulse width modulation on the gate of a  MOSFET that is carrying the signal.  Should we have used an op-amp?  Of course. Did we have to overclock the Arduino to avoid a horrid 1000Hz square wave from being played through the speakers. Definitely. Would I go back and do it differently?  Probably not.</p>
<h5 id="3-synchronize-music">3. Synchronize Music</h5>
<p>It would‚Äôve been nice to have a single centralized source of music.  However, we ended up just plugging a phone/laptop into each Soundscape speaker and starting the songs at the same time. HEY, IT WORKED FOR THE DEMO!</p>

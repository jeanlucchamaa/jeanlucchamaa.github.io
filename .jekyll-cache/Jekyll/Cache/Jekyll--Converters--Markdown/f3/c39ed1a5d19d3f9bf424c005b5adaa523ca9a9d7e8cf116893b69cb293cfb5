I"T<p>This project is the both the origin of my maker journey, and the greatest continuing driver of it.  I wanted to create an interface for controlling a super cool RGB LED strip and to replace the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aAzoZlt.png">crappy IR remote</a> that it came with.  That was the original goal.  It started as a small box with 3 potentiometers, 3 MOSFETs, and an LCD screen. Since then, it has morphed countless times and is now - as of Feb 2018 - a Raspberry Pi-driven, web-connected, music-sensitive lighting powerhouse, which just happens to double as my sunrise alarm clock.</p>

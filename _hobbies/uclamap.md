I'm a big fan of maps, and all I wanted to hang on the wall of my room was an interesting map of my alma mater -- something unique!  I looked on Etsy and Society6 and a bunch of other custom art websites, but I couldn't find anything that fit my fancy.  So I decided to make my own!

### QGIS
I didn't have any experience with map-making software, but smart people pointed me to QGIS, a free, powerful, open-source GIS (Geographic Information System) program.  Using open-source community-derived maps from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), I got vector layers of all the relvant information in the area.

The process went as follows:

---

**Contrast a rough outline of the campus with a powder blue background.**

---

**Separate campus polygons and non-campus polygons into individual layers, and make the latter pale and flat.**

**Add in campus polygons with drop-shadow and color applied depending on whether the polygon is grass, water, or a building.**

**Add in the roads and paths, with thickness dependent on the type of traffic.**

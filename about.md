Hello!

I'm Jean-Luc --- an excessively enthusiastic engineer, designer, and maker.  I enjoy creating novel hardware and software widgets, especially in partnership with other engineers. 

I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering (with technical breadth in Computer Science) from UCLA,
as well as 1+ years of professional experience as a software engineer, and 5+ years of project-based hands-on experience in electrical engineering, software design, and web development.

I'm a diligent self-learner who takes on projects with heart, both at and outside of work.  I'm always building some passion project at home, outside of being a full-time employee or student, doubling down my efforts during breaks, weekends, and holidays when I have more time to devote.
I really have a passion for the work I do, and I thrive in workplaces where people feel likewise.  

If you have a job or a project that I might be able to help you with, please do reach out via e-mail at [jlchamaa@gmail.com](mailto:jlchamaa@gmail.com) .
